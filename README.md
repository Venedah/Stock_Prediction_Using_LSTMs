## Recurrent Neural Network(LSTM) with Keras Framework

## About RNNs
> Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the      popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.

## Different types of Recurrent Neural Networks
  1. Image Classification
  2. Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words).
  3. Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing a positive or negative sentiment).
  4. Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French).
  5. Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video)

## Predicted stock price for Google's trending Stock data
  1. Successfully predicted Google stock price by using last 5 year's data of Google stock price.
  2. Use of RNN(LSTM) was implemented alongside with Keras framework producing some good results.
